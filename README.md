OCNES
=======
Operations Center Network Event Summary (OCNES) provides a dashboard view of network health. It is built on top of the [AKiPS Network Monitoring Software](http://akips.com) network monitoring platform, which provides all polling and status data.

## Why?

The AKiPS platform is a powerful tool on its own.  OCNES was developed using the AKiPS API to provide a view summarized for network and device topologies.

## Install

Setup is needed inside AKiPS.  Refer to [Setup Readme](akips_setup/README.md).

## Running

This project was initially designed to run under OpenShift.

It also runs under Docker, refer to [Docker Readme](Docker.md).

Most recently work has been to build a K3s setup.
